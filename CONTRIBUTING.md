# Contributing

## What this repository accepts

- A correction, a source update, or a new practice or antipattern under
  `practices/` or `antipatterns/`, backed by a link to a source you
  actually re-fetched (see `docs/maintain/authoring.md` and
  `docs/maintain/verification.md`).
- A fix to a check, script, guard rule, or workflow under `scripts/`,
  `starter/writing-guard/`, or `.github/workflows/`.
- A documentation fix to `README.md`, `docs/adr/`, or `docs/maintain/`.

Open an issue first for anything larger than a small fix, so the approach
is agreed before you spend time on a pull request. `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/maintain/authoring.md` describe this repository's conventions and
check suite.

## Opening a pull request

- PR titles match `#N: summary`, where `N` is the issue the PR addresses.
- Run `pnpm check --strict` and `pnpm test` locally before opening the PR;
  both must pass.
- The maintainer reviews every pull request before it merges.
